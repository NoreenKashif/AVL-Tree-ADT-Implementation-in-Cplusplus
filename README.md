Title: AVL Tree ADT Implementation in C++

Description:
This project provides an implementation of the AVL Tree Abstract Data Type (ADT) in C++. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains height balance to ensure efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

Key Features:
1. Insertion and Deletion: The ADT supports efficient insertion and deletion operations, ensuring that the tree remains balanced after each operation. It automatically performs rotations and rebalancing as needed to maintain the AVL tree properties.

2. Search and Retrieval: The ADT includes functions to search for a specific value within the AVL tree and retrieve the associated data. The search operation is optimized with the binary search algorithm, taking advantage of the AVL tree's balanced structure.

3. Tree Traversal: The ADT provides mechanisms for traversing the AVL tree in various orders, such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order. These traversal operations allow access to the values stored in the tree in a specific order.

4. Height and Size Calculation: The ADT offers functions to determine the height and size of the AVL tree. These metrics provide insights into the overall structure and performance characteristics of the tree.

5. Modularity and Reusability: The implementation follows a modular design, separating the AVL tree ADT functionality from the driver code. This promotes code reusability and allows easy integration into other projects.

The project provides a clear and well-documented implementation of the AVL Tree ADT in C++. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding AVL trees and their operations, as well as a solid foundation for incorporating the ADT into your own applications.

Whether you are a beginner seeking to learn about self-balancing trees or an experienced programmer looking for a reliable implementation, this project can be an invaluable asset. Explore the code, experiment with the provided operations, and adapt the implementation to meet your specific requirements.
